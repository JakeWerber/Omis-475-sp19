  <div> <h3> Baseball </h3> 

      <p>My favorite sport is baseball, I say this because I have played it since I was a little kid.  I have always loved finding a 
        group of friends and playing a pick up game of baseball until the sun started to sink.  I also love to watch baseball on TV, my 
        favorite team to watch is the Chicago Cubs.  My favorite player on the Cubs is Javy Baez or Chris Bryant. For more information on
        the Cubs or baseball in general please visit the website by clicking on the link. </p>
