        <P>My favorite movie was Interstellar because it had to deal with space and what other possibilties there are in the world.
            Another reason I like the movie is because it really makes you think about the plot and makes you want to guess what will 
            happen next.  The best part is that you will never guess what will happen next so you just keep watching it.  If I had to give 
            Interstellar a rating I would give it a 9/10 and it will always be one of my favorite movies.
