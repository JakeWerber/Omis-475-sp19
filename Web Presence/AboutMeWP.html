              <H1>About Me</H1>
              <p>Hi I am a 21 year old college student that currently goes to Northern Illinois University. At NIU I am studying OM&IS which stands for 
                 Operational Management and Information Systems.  In simpler terms I do a lot of data work and procurement / warehouse work.  You get to choose
                  one or the other to specialize in.  I choose the IS side because I love to work on computers and do math to find a solution 
                  to a problem.  I am currently in my last year here at NIU and I loved every second of it.  I met some of the best people I have ever had the privilege 
                  of meeting who became my best friends.  I got the chance to join a fraternity (Sigma Nu) where I met a lot of these people. I love to travel and
                  play sports with my friends.  You can find more information about that on the My Interest page.  I was born and raised in Illinois and love the state.
                  Thatâ€™s pretty much everything about me.  Thanks for looking at my website!
