      <h2>Sports</h2>
      <p>My other biggest interest has to be sports.  I have loved sports since I was a young kid, I have always had a interest in playing even though
          I wasn't very good.  I have always loved to watch them as well as play them with my friends or on a minor league team.  My favorite sport is baseball,
          I have played since I could rememeber.<img src="Cubs.png" alt="Pineapple" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">  My favorite positon was catcher because I got to be in every play.  I also enjoy watching my favorite baseball team the
          Chicago Cubs.  My other favorite sport is Football that is american football.  I was never good at playing football so I mainly just watched it with 
          my dad.  My Favorite team is the Chicago Bears, I am hoping for a superbowl win this year.
