                    <h2> Sigma Nu </h2>
                    <p> When I first came to NIU I had a friend in a fraternity called Sigma Nu. They convinced me to join which know is one of the best
	                        decisions I have ever made.  I have made a lot of connections throughout my time at Sigma Nu.  My greatest accomplishment at Sigma Nu was
	                    that I became what is now called "Head of General Membership".  In this position if any non-executive members had a problem or wanted to talk 
	                they came to me so that I could go to the executive board and voice the complaints of any member.  This was a huge step in my life, and I am very glad
	                    I was able to this.

                    <h2> Community Service </h2>
                    <p>During my time at NIU I have been able to help my community through community service.  I have had about 80 hours of community service while here
                        at NIU.  One of the community service projects that I am most proud of is called NIU cares day.  At NIU cares day you are split into teams and then are 
                    assigned a place to go.  I was assigned to go to a Dekalb museum where we spent the day pulling weeds, laying wood chips, and doing other chores around
                the property.  I loved this one the most because you got to see the before and after and when you are done you are proud that you helped.

                    <h2> Other Accomplishments </h2>
                    <p>The last accomplishment that I will talk about is my time in other organizations, I was in APICS and CAB.  APICS is a Operational Management
                        club here on campus where you tour warehouses and other production facilities.  CAB stands for campus activity board which is a school organization that
                        holds events for the students here at NIU.  I am happy with my decision to joining the organization and help educate myself and help the students
                        here at NIU have more fun while at school.
